## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The goal is to train a neural network to accurately identify digits from 0 to 9 that are handwritten.

In this project, we use the MNIST dataset, which consists of a large number of grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels. We implement a CNN model to classify these digits.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
```

2. Download and preprocess the MNIST dataset:

The dataset is automatically downloaded and preprocessed in the code. You don't need to download it separately.

## Usage

1. Open the `digit_recognition.py` file.

2. Customize the hyperparameters (if needed) such as the number of epochs, batch size, etc.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python digit_recognition.py
```

4. The model will be trained and evaluated, and the test accuracy will be displayed.

## Results

After running the script, you will see the training progress and the final test accuracy achieved by the model. The accuracy indicates how well the model is performing on classifying handwritten digits.
